![](screenshots/sample-overall-architecture.png "Overall Architecture of our Sample Project")

We will create an **Express** server then hook to a **Datastore** and then load up pre-built GraphiQL to test some test queries.

**GraphiQL**

- solely made for development purposes to help us feel how GraphQL works and how we can execute queries with it
- made by GraphQL team
